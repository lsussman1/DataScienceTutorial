    "   The dataset we have begun looking at is the World Happiness Report. The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness ranging over 156 countries. The report includes data from the years 2015 to 2019 and includes correlated data about each country’s economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – factors that affect the quality of life. This data was collected from the Gallup World Poll, which asks participants to rate how close they are to their ideal possible life on a scale from 0 to 10. The report also includes a benchmark “dystopia” that has “the world’s lowest incomes, lowest life expectancy, lowest generosity, most corruption, least freedom, and least social support”(Sustainable Development Solutions Network). \n",
    "   Due to the current issues facing the world, we were intrigued by data that measures something positive. We plan to analyze how different events such as natural disasters and elections affect happiness as well as related measures such as the level of generosity and citizen's perception of corruption. We plan to answer questions such as “did any country experience a significant increase or decrease in happiness?” For example, it would be interesting to analyze the effects on the “Trust (Government Corruption)” score for America after Trump’s election in 2016. Other interesting events to look at might include natural disasters or the beginning or end of a war. We also plan to look at the relationship between wealth and happiness by comparing the “Economy (GDP per capita)” score to the “Happiness Score” per country. This may give some insight into the common discussion of “can money buy happiness?” With this question, we predict that money and happiness may be proportional until a certain threshold. Another factor that will likely affect this correlation is the distribution of wealth within a country, which might be available through another database. Another relevant question to ask would be comparing the happiness score with the rate of Coronavirus deaths per country, which is data we will likely be able to source. Rather than determining if Coronavirus deaths affected happiness score (which is not possible because there is no data yet for 2020), we could determine if national happiness played a role in how well countries dealt with the Coronavirus outbreak. Countries with happier people might have had an easier time convincing their citizens to stay home, social distance, and wear a mask, leading to lower death rates.\n",

    "   We plan to meet on Zoom each Thursday after class to review what tasks need to be completed before each Milestone deadline. We will make sure to leave each meeting with both partners understanding what they are responsible for completing before the next meeting. We set up a private Github repository to collaborate on code, and will communicate via text to stay updated on any roadblocks or bugs we are experiencing.\n",
